\title: Lab 3: Virtual world and specular shading

# 1) Hierarcical modelling, the windmill

## How can you get all four blades to rotate with just one time-dependent rotation matrix?

## How do you make the wings follow the body's movements?

## You may have to tweak some numbers to make the placement right. How can you do that without making a lot of small changes in numbers in the code followed by recompilations?


# 2) Manual viewing controls

## What kind of control did you implement?

## Can you make this kind of control in some other way than manipulating a "look-at" matrix?


# 3) Virtual world and skybox

## How did you handle the camera matrix for the skybox?

## How did you represent the objects? Is this a good way to manage a scene or would you do it differently for a "real" application?

## What special considerations are needed when rendering a skybox?

## What is the problem with the skybox object used in the lab? (The problem doesn't have to be corrected.)


# 4) Specular shading, external light sources

## How do you generate a vector from the surface to the eye?

## Which vectors need renormalization in the fragment shader?


# 5) Multitexturing

## How did you choose to combine the texture colour and the lighting colour?

## How did you choose to combine the two textures?


# Extra) Managing transparency

## How did you remove the errors caused by transparency?
