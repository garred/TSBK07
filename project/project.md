# Design history

- Create a tank skeleton
  - Create nodes and links with verlet physics
  - Make the nodes interact with the terrain
- Add physics to the tank skeleton
- Add a tank model to the skeleton
- Add lights




# Brief description of the project

I want to make a simple tanks game. You control a tank that moves over an heightmap-based terrain and you have to destroy enemy tanks.

# List of "will do" features

- Articulated boxed tank composed of body, turret and cannon, controlled by the player.
- Natural objects: rocks, trees.
- Shoots that hit terrain and objects.
- Enemy tanks with simple AI that shoots to you.
- Lights effects in shoots and explosions.
- Skydome.

# List of "might do" features

- Moving clouds.
- Destructible objects (rocks, trees, tanks) by hitting or shooting.
- Better AI: moving enemy tanks.
- Deformable terrain.
- Procedurally generated maps.
- Better 3d models for tanks and other objects.
- Some kind of simple physics engine, maybe based on boxes made of 3d points and springs.
- Sounds.
- Graphics effects (particles).
